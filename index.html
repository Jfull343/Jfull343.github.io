         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Biblical Studies. My brother and I have a small lawn service that I work for. </p>
         <p>
            I attend Faith Baptist Church in Easley, SC. My dad is the pastor and my brother is the assistant/youth pastor. Connected to my church is 
             a Christian school that all of my older brothers and sisters work at including my two sister-in-laws.
            
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy playing my trumpet and watching basketball. My favorite college basketball team to watch is the Wisconsin Badgers!
